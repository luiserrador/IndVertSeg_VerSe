# Individual Vertebrae Segmentation on VerSe Dataset

This is the implementation of iterative vertebrae segmentation on [VerSe](https://github.com/anjany/verse) datasets (2019 and 2020). Vertebrae segmentation is accomplished by first finding the spine location on CT volume and then performing an iterative segmentation of vertebrae from top to down:

## 1. Usage

After moving to the repo directory, the first thing to do is to clone [ML_3D_Unet](https://github.com/luiserrador/ML_3D_Unet) repo which is needed:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/luiserrador/ML_3D_Unet.git
```
Download VerSe dataset:

<sub>**Note:** We strongly recommend to test the repository with the data available. So, test steps 1.1 and 1.2 before downloanding all the data!</sub>
```
$ python get_verse_data.py
```

### 1.1 Training spine location network
```
$ python pre_processing_heatmap.py
$ python train_heatmap.py
```

### 1.2 Training segmentation network
```
$ python pre_processing_segmentation.py
$ python train_segmentation.py
```

## 2. Inference

The inference functionality has been integrated directly into a larger software system and is not available as a standalone script.
To maintain consistency with our deployment environment and reduce confusion, we only provide the training scripts and a pseudocode description of the inference process.

If you're interested in reusing the model for research or development, please refer to the pseudocode below or reach out for collaboration.
